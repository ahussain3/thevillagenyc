    <p class="info" style="text-align:center;"><em><a href="#contact">I'm interested! How can I get in touch?</a></em></p>
    <p>We feel that human beings flourish in healthy, welcoming communities. However, with long commute times, tiny apartments, and few free-of-charge public spaces, many modern cities seem to be designed specifically to resist collective living, and so it takes a conscious effort to make it happen.</p>

    <p>With this in mind, we are hoping to gather a group of 4-7 people to live together in a (leased) large 5-8 bedroom brownstone in Brooklyn, and work together to create a harmonious, community-oriented living situation.</p>

    <p>If you find yourself resonating with the rest of this document, then <a href="#contact">please reach out to us</a> and maybe we can be housemates one day!</p>

    <p>Our goal is to create an environment that everyone enjoys coming back to each evening. In addition to becoming a supportive living space, the home will be used as a base for projects, hobbies, and events: whether that means cooking together on a regular basis, hosting book clubs and open mics, or collaborating on big art pieces.</p>

    <p> To enjoy living in the house, you likely already believe that American culture (and NYC in particular) is a little too individualistic, and that we would all benefit from some amount of interdependence, responsibility towards others and sense of community.</p>

    <h2 id="values">Values</h2>
    <h3 id="the-values-we-want-to-embody-">The values we want to embody:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>The living room is a public space:</strong> We'd like to host events and have new people over quite often, and to be the kind of place that's welcoming to them. If you prefer your home to be quiet and not social, then this might not be the right fit for you.</li>
    <li><strong>The house is yours:</strong> Residents should feel like they have the power to do what they want to with the space (as long as it doesn't violate the lease :)). If something isn't working for you, you should feel empowered to change it.</li>
    <li><strong>We are there for each other:</strong> We all have the alternative of living in a 2-4 bedroom apartment with roommates we hardly talk to. The purpose of this project is that we all enjoy taking an interest in the lives of the other residents.</li>
    <li><strong>We are not restricted by profession:</strong> We don't want this to be a "tech house" or a "house for creatives". We'd prefer instead to organize around character traits like emotional intelligence, empathy and the shared desire for collective living.</li>

    </ul>
    <h3 id="timeline-">Timeline:</h3>
    <p>Nothing is guaranteed, but we are aiming to move in on <strong>1st June 2020</strong>. It may be sooner if we get a group of people together quickly.</p>
    <h3 id="events">Events</h2>
    <p>We anticipate that we will be hosting events regularly. These can take place in any of the larger common rooms in the house. Some things we have in mind:</p>
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>Reading groups / book clubs / writing workshops</li>
    <li>Salon style discussion groups or guest lectures</li>
    <li>Music listening sessions and/or jam sessions</li>
    <li>Board game nights</li>
    <li>Parties (limit to no more than every ~2 months for big/loud parties)</li>
    <li>Communal dinners (potentially a dinner for 10-20 people every week)</li>
    <li>...Hackathons?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="about-us">About Us</h2>
    <p><strong>Awais</strong> - I am a software engineer at a mobile money company called <a href="https://wave.engineering/about/" target="_blank">Wave</a>. We do a lot of work in Africa but I have the option to work remotely which is why I'd like to move to New York and stay there for a few years. I studied physics and philosophy at college (so love abstract debates). After college I backpacked around India for around 18 months where I got pretty curious about meditation and wrote a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Travels-India-Awais-Hussain/dp/1719451370" target="_blank">collection of essays</a>. You can read my <a href="https://awais.io/" target="_blank">blog here</a>.</p>
    <p>I also lived in London for a year where I stayed in a co-living arrangement called <a href="https://www.nwspk.com/" target="_blank">Newspeak House</a> which is my main reference point for what is possible in this kind of space.</p>
    <p><strong>Jackson</strong> - I also work at Wave. I'll fill this out later :)</p>
    <h2 id="the-house">The House</h2>
    <p>Finding the right house is both important and difficult. For this reason, we'd like to have a rough idea of who is interested ahead of time, so that we can meet everyone's preferences, and if a property does come onto the market, we can snap it up quickly.</p>
    <h3 id="what-we-are-looking-for-in-a-house-">What we are looking for in a house:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Space. It would be great to have one or two large common spaces so we can entertain guests.</li>
    <li>A big kitchen that we all feel happy spending time in.</li>
    <li>Aiming for an average rent of <strong>$1,400</strong> per month per room. Individual rooms may be more or less than this, but this seems to be the right balance between affordable and realistic.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Below are some examples of houses we have found that could work out (we are still looking so this list may be updated over time):</p>
    <h3 id="-8br-townhouse-on-lincoln-pl-park-slope-11-000-https-newyork-craigslist-org-brk-apa-d-brooklyn-townhouse-for-rent-in-the-park-7073802790-html-"><a href="https://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/apa/d/brooklyn-townhouse-for-rent-in-the-park/7073802790.html" target="_blank">8br on 98 Lincoln Pl, Park Slope - $11,000</a></h3>
    <p>This house is very spacious. It has several living spaces where we can host events, two basements, and 8 bedrooms. The main issues are the number of shared bathrooms (there is only one bathroom per floor), and the fact that 4 of the bedrooms are very small.</p>

    <p>The bedrooms on the middle floor of this house are huge (they are almost studio apartments) and share a very nice bathroom. The large upstairs rooms also have en-suite bathrooms which is a bonus.</p>

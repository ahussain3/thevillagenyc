# Co-living in NYC

We are hoping to gather a group of 4-7 people who want to live together in New York. The plan is to lease a large 4-5 bedroom space (likely in Brooklyn), and work together to create a comfortable, community-oriented living situation. If you find yourself resonating with the rest of this document, then reach out to us and maybe we can be housemates one day!

The big thing we’re trying to do is make living in New York a more pleasant experience, since it can be a pretty difficult place to exist in at times. Our goal is to create an environment that everyone enjoys coming back to each evening. In addition to becoming a supportive living space, the home can be used as a base for projects, hobbies, and events: whether that means cooking together on a regular basis, hosting book clubs and open mics, or collaborating on big art pieces.

We feel that human beings flourish in healthy, welcoming communities. With long commute times, tiny apartments, and few free-of-charge public spaces, many modern cities seem to be designed specifically to resist collective living, and so it takes a conscious effort to make it happen. To enjoy living in the house, you will probably have to believe to some extent that American culture (and NYC in particular) is a little too individualistic, and that we would all benefit from some amount of interdependence, responsibility towards others and sense of community.

We hope that by doing some work up front - namely finding a great group of people to live with and searching for a great living space - we can do better.

### The values we want to embody:
* **The living room is a public space:** It’s likely that we’ll have new people over fairly often. We’d like to be the kind of place that’s welcoming to them, but we’re also very committed to making sure they’re the kinds of people you would want in your home. If you prefer your home to be quiet and not social, then this might not be the right fit for you.
* **The house is yours:** Residents should feel like they have the power to do what they want to with the space (as long as it doesn’t violate the lease :)). If something isn’t working for you, you should feel empowered to change it. There will be a weekly meeting to make sure that everyone is on the same page about where the house is going.
* **We are there for each other:** We all have the alternative of living in a 2-4 bedroom apartment with roommates we hardly talk to. Part of the purpose of this project is that we agree to share our lives to some extent with our housemates. That means joining in on communal activities and taking an interest in the lives of the other residents.

### Timeline:
Nothing is guaranteed, but we are aiming to move in on **1st June 2020**.

## Events:
We anticipate that we will be hosting events regularly. Depending on the capacity of the space we end up in, we may need to limit the number of people that can attend. Some things we have in mind:
* Reading groups / book clubs / writing workshops
* Salon style discussion groups or guest lectures
* Music listening sessions and/or jam sessions
* Board game nights
* Parties (limit to no more than every ~2 months for big/loud parties)
* Communal dinners (potentially a dinner for 10-20 people every week)
* … Hackathons?

## About Us
**Awais** - I am a software engineer at a mobile money company called Wave. We do a lot of work in Africa but I have the option to work remotely which is why I’d like to move to New York and stay there for a few years. I studied physics and philosophy at college (so love abstract debates). After college I backpacked around India for around 18 months where I got pretty curious about meditation and wrote a collection of essays. You can read my blog here.

I also lived in London for a year where I stayed in a co-living arrangement called Newspeak House which is my main reference point for what is possible in this kind of space.

**Jackson** - I also work at Wave. I’ll fill this out later.

## The House

Finding a house is both important and difficult. For this reason, we’d like to have a rough idea of who is interested ahead of time, so that if a property does come onto the market, we can snap it up quickly.

### What we are looking for in a house:
* Space. It would be great to have one or two large common spaces so we can entertain guests.
* A big kitchen that we all feel happy spending time in.
* Aiming for an average rent of $1,400 per month per room. Individual rooms may be more or less than this, but this seems to be the right balance between affordable and realistic.

Based on initial searches it seems like the kind of place we are looking for is going to be hard to come by. If you know of anywhere, please let us know!

Below are some examples of houses we would love to live in but which are above our price range. Hopefully this will give you a little sense of what we’re dreaming about.
